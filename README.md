# Welcome to the single-station multi-server queueing analyzer.

## There are two jupyter notebooks. One for the $GI/GI/k$ model (ggc_gitub.ipynb). The other for the $GI/GI_i/2$ model. 

## From each notebook one can upload the trained neural network (NN) and make inferece.

## The trained NNs inside the folder models.

## Also, one can find inside the folder data examples.

## In the notebooks there are example and illustrations how the networks are made.
